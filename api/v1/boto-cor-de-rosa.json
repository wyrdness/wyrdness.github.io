      "full": "The Boto Cor-de-Rosa (pink river dolphin) represents one of the Amazon Basin's most enduring and complex folklore traditions, weaving together observations of real cetacean behavior, cultural explanations for social phenomena, and deeply rooted beliefs about the relationship between humans and the aquatic realm. Unlike the broader category of *encantados* (enchanted beings), the boto mythology focuses specifically on the biology, behavior, and perceived supernatural qualities of the Amazon river dolphin (*Inia geoffrensis*), creating a unique intersection of natural history and supernatural narrative. This shapeshifting entity, said to transform from pink dolphin to handsome young man under cover of darkness, serves multiple cultural functions in Amazonian societies: explaining paternity outside marriage, enforcing behavioral norms around water safety and sexual conduct, and expressing the complex relationship between riverine communities and their aquatic environment. The boto legend persists into the modern era, influencing conservation attitudes, tourism, and regional identity throughout the Brazilian Amazon."
