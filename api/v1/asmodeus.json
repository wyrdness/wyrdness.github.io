      "full": "Asmodeus (also Asmodai, Ashmedai) is one of the most prominent demons in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic demonology, typically associated with **lust, wrath, and revenge**. Appearing in the Book of Tobit and later elaborated in the Talmud, grimoires, and Christian demonology, Asmodeus is often counted among the seven princes of Hell, specifically ruling over the sin of lust. In Jewish tradition (Talmud), Asmodeus is sometimes portrayed almost sympathetically as a powerful jinn or demon with complex motivations, even possessing wisdom and serving as a reluctant helper to King Solomon. In Christian demonology, especially in medieval grimoires like the Lesser Key of Solomon, he appears as one of the 72 demons with specific powers over lust, gambling, and discord in marriages."
