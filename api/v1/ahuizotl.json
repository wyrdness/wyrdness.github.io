      "full": "The ahuizotl is a fearsome water creature from Aztec mythology, described as having the body of a medium-sized dog with sleek, waterproof fur, monkey-like hands on its limbs, and most distinctively, a human-like hand at the end of its long tail. According to Aztec belief, the ahuizotl inhabits lakes and rivers, particularly in the Texcoco lake region of the Valley of Mexico. It uses its tail-hand to grab unsuspecting people near the water's edge, dragging them down to drown. The creature was said to prefer victims with shiny features, particularly teeth and eyes. In Aztec cosmology, the ahuizotl served **Tlaloc**, the rain god, and those it drowned were considered sacrifices to this deity. ⚠️ **CULTURAL SENSITIVITY**: The ahuizotl is part of Aztec spiritual and religious heritage. Approach with respect for Indigenous Mesoamerican cultural traditions."
