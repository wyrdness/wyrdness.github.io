      "full": "The Al-Mi'raj is a legendary creature from Islamic folklore, described as a large yellow rabbit with a single black spiraling horn protruding from its forehead. Despite its seemingly harmless and cute appearance, medieval Islamic texts portray this creature as ferociously carnivorous and capable of killing prey much larger than itself, including humans and other animals. Originating from accounts of a mysterious island in the Indian Ocean, the Al-Mi'raj represents a recurring theme in medieval bestiaries: the danger of underestimating creatures based on their benign appearance. The creature has fascinated scholars as a potential Islamic influence on European unicorn mythology and as an example of medieval natural history's blend of observation and imagination."
