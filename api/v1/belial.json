      "full": "Belial (also Beliar) is a demon or personification of worthlessness and wickedness appearing in Jewish and Christian texts. The name derives from Hebrew \\\"בְּלִיַּעַל\\\" (beli ya'al), meaning \\\"**without worth**\\\" or \\\"lawless.\\\" In the Hebrew Bible, \\\"belial\\\" often appears as a descriptor for wickedness, but later Jewish and Christian tradition personified Belial as a specific demon—one of the most powerful. In the **Dead Sea Scrolls**, Belial appears as leader of the forces of darkness opposing the Sons of Light. **2 Corinthians 6:15** asks \\\"What accord has Christ with Belial?\\\"—showing personification in New Testament era. Medieval demonology elevated Belial to one of the most powerful demons, sometimes **second only to Satan**, or even identified with Satan. The **Lesser Key of Solomon** lists him as the 68th demon, a mighty king. Belial represents **lawlessness, chaos, destruction, and worthlessness**—the opposite of divine order and value."
