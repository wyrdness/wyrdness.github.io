      "full": "Belphegor (also Baal-Peor) is a demon associated with the deadly sin of **sloth**, as well as inventions, discoveries, and wealth. Originally **Baal-Peor**, a Moabite god mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (Numbers 25), later demonization transformed him into Belphegor, one of the **seven princes of Hell** corresponding to the seven deadly sins. In medieval Christian demonology, Belphegor is Hell's ambassador to France (in some traditions), and he tempts people through **laziness, apathy, and ingenious inventions** that promote comfort over virtue. He also has associations with **discord in marriages** and seduction through promises of wealth or easy solutions. An odd folkloric tradition claims Belphegor appears on toilets (relating to his association with bodily laziness and impropriety), though this is likely medieval crude humor. In occult tradition, he may reveal discoveries and inventions to magicians who summon him properly."
