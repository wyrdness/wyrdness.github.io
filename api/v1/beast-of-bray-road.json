      "full": "The **Beast of Bray Road** is a cryptid creature reported primarily from rural Walworth County, Wisconsin, particularly along Bray Road near the town of Elkhorn. Since the late 1980s, witnesses have described encounters with a large, bipedal, wolf-like or bear-like creature that exhibits characteristics of both animals and humans. The Beast is often compared to werewolf legends and represents one of North America's most prominent \\\"dogman\\\" or \\\"wolfman\\\" sightings. Unlike traditional European werewolf folklore involving transformation from human to wolf, the Beast of Bray Road appears to be a consistently animal-like creature capable of bipedal locomotion. Standing 6 to 7 feet tall when upright, covered in dark fur, with a wolf-like or dog-like head, powerful limbs, and glowing eyes, the creature has been seen by dozens of witnesses over more than three decades. Most sightings occur at night on rural roads, often with the creature standing on two legs, crouching over roadkill, or running alongside or in front of vehicles. The modern wave of sightings began in the late 1980s when several witnesses reported encounters along Bray Road, a rural county road southeast of Elkhorn. Local journalist Linda Godfrey investigated and published reports beginning in 1991, bringing national attention to the phenomenon. Her reporting transformed scattered local rumors into a coherent narrative that attracted cryptozoology researchers, paranormal investigators, and curious tourists. The Beast of Bray Road has become Wisconsin's most famous cryptid, spawning books, documentaries, a feature film, and an annual tourism boost to Walworth County. Skeptics attribute sightings to misidentified bears, large dogs, or hoaxes, while believers suggest the creature could be an unknown canid species, a relic population of prehistoric mammals, or even a supernatural entity connected to Native American shapeshifter traditions. Regardless of its true nature, the Beast has secured a permanent place in Wisconsin folklore and American cryptozoology."
