      "full": "The **Bake-kujira** (化け鯨, \\\"ghost whale\\\") is a terrifying apparition from Japanese coastal folklore—a massive **whale skeleton with no flesh**, rising from the ocean depths accompanied by schools of strange fish and eerie birds. This ghost whale appears near whaling villages on **misty, rainy nights**, serving as a harbinger of doom. The Bake-kujira brings **curses, pestilence, famine, and disaster** to the communities that encounter it, representing the vengeful spirit of whales killed by whalers. When fishermen attempt to harpoon it, their weapons **pass harmlessly through** its skeletal form—there is no flesh to pierce, no body to wound. The creature embodies **nature's revenge** for environmental destruction and overexploitation, making it one of folklore's most powerful ecological allegories."
