      "full": "The Chimera is a monstrous hybrid creature from Greek mythology, described as having the **head and body of a lion**, a **second head of a goat** protruding from its back, and a **tail ending in a serpent's head** or dragon. A fire-breathing female monster, the Chimera was the offspring of the giants Typhon and Echidna. She terrorized the region of Lycia until being slain by the hero **Bellerophon**, who rode the winged horse **Pegasus** to attack from above. The Chimera has become the quintessential symbol of **impossible hybrids** and **fantastical combinations**. The term \\\"chimera\\\" now means any fantastical or impossible idea. In genetics, **chimerism** refers to organisms containing cells with different DNA, named after this mythological beast."
