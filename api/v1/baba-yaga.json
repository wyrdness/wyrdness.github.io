      "full": "Baba Yaga is a legendary witch from Slavic folklore, particularly prominent in Russian fairy tales. She is an ambiguous character who is neither purely good nor evil, operating by her own inscrutable rules. Depicted as an old woman with iron teeth and bony legs, she flies through the forest in a mortar, using a pestle as a rudder. Her dwelling is a hut that stands on chicken legs, spins around, and can only be entered by speaking a specific phrase. The fence around her home is topped with skulls whose eyes glow in the darkness. Baba Yaga tests visitors with difficult tasks and riddles; she may devour those who fail or displease her, but helps the pure-hearted. She possesses powerful magic, controls day and night through three horsemen, and can shape-shift. She represents wild nature, serves as guardian of the threshold between worlds, and embodies themes of death, rebirth, and the wise crone archetype. ⚠️ **Cultural Sensitivity**: Baba Yaga is a core element of Slavic folklore and cultural heritage."
