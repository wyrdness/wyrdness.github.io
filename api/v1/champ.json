      "full": "Champ is the legendary aquatic cryptid said to inhabit Lake Champlain, a 120-mile-long freshwater lake straddling the border between Vermont, New York, and Quebec. Often called \\\"North America's Loch Ness Monster,\\\" Champ has been the subject of hundreds of reported sightings over the past four centuries, Indigenous oral traditions spanning millennia, and ongoing scientific investigation. The creature is typically described as a large, serpentine animal with a long neck, multiple humps, and a horse-like or snake-like head. Lake Champlain's considerable depth (maximum 400 feet), extensive underwater cave systems, and abundant fish populations have fueled speculation that the lake could support a population of unknown large aquatic animals. The legend has generated significant cultural impact, becoming deeply embedded in regional identity and contributing substantially to local tourism economies."
