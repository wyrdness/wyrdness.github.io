      "full": "The Bridgewater Triangle is an area of approximately 200 square miles in southeastern Massachusetts, bounded roughly by the towns of Abington, Freetown, and Rehoboth. Coined by cryptozoologist Loren Coleman in the 1970s, this region has been the site of numerous reports of paranormal activity. Reported phenomena include UFO sightings, cryptid encounters (Bigfoot, thunderbirds, giant snakes), mysterious lights, cattle mutilations, phantom vehicles (trucks and helicopters), and alleged cult activity. The area encompasses Hockomock Swamp—known to the Wampanoag people as the \\\"Place of Spirits\\\"—Freetown-Fall River State Forest, and various sites connected to Native American history and colonial conflicts including King Philip's War. Theories to explain the concentration of reports range from paranormal vortexes and sacred land energies to more mundane explanations like confirmation bias, media amplification, and misidentification of natural phenomena."
