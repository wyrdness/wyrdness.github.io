      "full": "The Brown Mountain Lights are mysterious light phenomena observed near Brown Mountain in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. With **over 250 years of documented reports**, they represent the **most historically consistent light phenomenon in the United States**. Characterized by pale lights that rise above the mountain ridge with a steady glow in various colors, the phenomenon appears in Cherokee legends that predate European contact. The first written documentation dates to 1771, when a German engineer recorded observing strange lights in the area. Multiple investigations have attempted to explain the lights: The phenomenon remains **partially explained**: while some modern sightings can be attributed to distant light sources refracted through atmospheric layers, the pre-modern reports (predating automobiles, trains, and electric lights) and Cherokee legends remain unexplained."
