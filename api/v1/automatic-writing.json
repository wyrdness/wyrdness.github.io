      "full": "Automatic writing (also psychography or trance writing) is the practice of **writing without conscious thought**, supposedly allowing spirits, subconscious minds, or other sources to communicate through a person's hand. The writer typically enters a trance or dissociative state, allowing the hand to move across paper without deliberate control, producing written messages. The phenomenon gained prominence during the **Spiritualist movement** (19th-20th century), when mediums used automatic writing to channel messages from the dead. Modern practitioners include **psychics, New Age adherents, and experimental psychologists**. Some writers report accessing creativity through automatic writing, while skeptics attribute it to the **ideomotor effect**—unconscious muscle movements. Automatic writing exists at the intersection of **spiritualism, psychology, creativity, and potential fraud**. While some cases clearly involve conscious deception, others represent genuine dissociative states or subconscious expression. The technique continues in modern spiritualist, occult, and therapeutic contexts."
