      "full": "Aokigahara (青木ヶ原, \\\"Sea of Blue Trees\\\"), also known as Jukai (樹海, \\\"Sea of Trees\\\"), is a dense forest at the northwest base of Mount Fuji in Japan. Formed approximately 1,200 years ago following the eruption of Mount Nagayama in 864 CE, Aokigahara is notable for its unique geological features, rich biodiversity, volcanic rock substrate, and cultural significance in Japanese history and folklore. The forest covers about 35 square kilometers and is characterized by extremely dense vegetation, twisted trees growing from hardened lava rock, numerous caves, and an eerie natural quietness due to the dense growth patterns that muffle sound. Aokigahara has gained international attention and infamy as a location associated with suicide, earning the unfortunate nickname \\\"Suicide Forest\\\"—a designation that many conservationists, mental health advocates, and local communities find disrespectful and harmful. While the forest has unfortunately been chosen as a suicide location by some individuals experiencing mental health crises, this represents a small aspect of the forest's reality and overshadows its ecological importance, cultural history, spiritual significance, and the dedicated conservation and suicide prevention efforts undertaken by local authorities, volunteers, and mental health organizations. The forest is also associated with paranormal phenomena in Japanese folklore, particularly beliefs about yūrei (troubled spirits) and the traditional practice of ubasute (elderly abandonment, historically debated among scholars). Local legends, spiritual beliefs about the mountain's sacred nature, and the psychological atmosphere of the dense, quiet forest contribute to its reputation as a haunted or spiritually charged location."
