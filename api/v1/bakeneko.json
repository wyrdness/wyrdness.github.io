      "full": "Bakeneko (化け猫, \\\"monster cat\\\" or \\\"changed cat\\\") is a type of Japanese yokai—a supernatural creature from Japanese folklore. According to tradition, ordinary cats that live for many years (typically 10-13 years), grow to an unusual size, or develop a particularly long tail can transform into bakeneko. These supernatural cats possess various magical abilities including shape-shifting into human form, speaking human language, walking upright on their hind legs, controlling fire, animating the dead (necromancy), and cursing humans. Bakeneko are particularly famous for their ability to perfectly impersonate murdered humans. The bakeneko's disposition varies: some act malevolently, often seeking revenge for mistreatment, while others are simply mischievous tricksters. A distinctive quirk is their fondness for eating lamp oil."
