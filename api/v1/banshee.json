      "full": "The **banshee** (Irish: *bean sí*, meaning \\\"woman of the fairy mound\\\") is one of the most famous figures in Irish folklore. She is a female spirit whose appearance or wailing cry announces that a member of a certain family is about to die. The banshee is traditionally attached to **specific Irish families**, particularly those with surnames beginning with 'O' or 'Mac' (ancient Gaelic nobility). She appears in various forms: Her most distinctive feature is her **wail**—a supernatural cry of mourning called *keening* that strikes terror and sorrow in those who hear it. The banshee is **not malevolent**; rather, she serves as a family guardian whose role is to mourn the passing of family members. The banshee tradition remains part of **living Irish folk culture**, with modern claimed experiences continuing to be reported."
