      "full": "The basilisk is a legendary reptile reputed to be the king of serpents, whose gaze or breath is lethally poisonous. In European tradition, it was described as a small snake with a crown-like crest on its head. Medieval accounts transformed it into a creature with a rooster's head and serpent's tail, often conflated with the cockatrice. The basilisk's powers include a deadly gaze that turns victims to stone or kills instantly, poisonous breath that withers all vegetation, and the ability to split rocks. First described by Pliny the Elder in the 1st century CE as a North African serpent, the basilisk likely originated from exaggerated accounts of cobras (whose hoods resemble crowns) combined with fear of venomous snakes."
