      "full": "The UFO/UAP phenomenon encompasses sightings of unidentified aerial objects and alleged encounters with non-human intelligences that have been reported throughout human history but gained prominence in the modern era beginning with the 1947 Kenneth Arnold sighting. The phenomenon includes simple sightings (Close Encounters of the First Kind), physical evidence cases (Second Kind), contact with occupants (Third Kind), abductions (Fourth Kind), and communication (Fifth Kind). In 2020, the US government officially acknowledged UAPs as a national security concern, releasing footage and establishing investigative offices. The phenomenon remains one of the most documented yet unexplained aspects of human experience, with thousands of credible witnesses including military personnel, pilots, and astronauts."
