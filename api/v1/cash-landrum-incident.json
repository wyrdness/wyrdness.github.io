      "full": "The Cash-Landrum Incident is one of the most disturbing and well-documented UFO encounters in history, primarily because of the severe physical injuries allegedly suffered by the witnesses. On the evening of December 29, 1980, Betty Cash, Vickie Landrum, and Vickie's seven-year-old grandson Colby encountered a large diamond-shaped object emitting intense heat and flames while driving on a rural road near Huffman, Texas. The object was reportedly accompanied by military helicopters, leading to speculation about secret government technology or a military recovery operation."
