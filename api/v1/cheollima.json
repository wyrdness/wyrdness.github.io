      "full": "The Cheollima, literally meaning \\\"thousand-li horse,\\\" is a mythical winged horse from Korean mythology capable of traveling one thousand li (approximately 400 kilometers or 250 miles) in a single day. This magnificent creature represents speed, ambition, excellence, and rapid progress in Korean culture. Unlike the Pegasus of Greek mythology, the Cheollima is deeply rooted in Korean values of tireless work, national development, and the pursuit of extraordinary achievement. The creature became particularly significant as a national symbol in North Korea, representing the rapid reconstruction and economic development following the Korean War."
