      "full": "Unlike its more famous cousins—Nessie of Loch Ness or Champ of Lake Champlain—Bessie inhabits a shallow, heavily trafficked, and well-studied body of water. Lake Erie is the shallowest of the Great Lakes (average depth only 62 feet) and borders major metropolitan areas, making the persistence of a large unknown animal seem unlikely to scientists. Yet sightings continue, with witnesses describing a dark, snake-like creature with a horse-like or dog-like head, sometimes with prominent eyes, creating a significant wake as it moves through the water. The creature gained particular attention in the 1980s and 1990s when a $100,000+ reward was offered for its capture (unharmed), though the reward went unclaimed. Bessie remains one of America's most reported freshwater cryptids, blending Native American legends, 19th-century maritime lore, and modern eyewitness accounts into an enduring mystery."
