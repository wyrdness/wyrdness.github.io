      "full": "Black Shuck is one of the most famous examples of British black dog folklore, a spectral hound that roams the coastlines and country roads of East Anglia, England. Described as a **large black dog the size of a calf**, with shaggy fur and **blazing red or green eyes**, Black Shuck is primarily known as a **death omen**—seeing the creature portends death within a year. The most famous incident occurred in **1577 at Bungay church**, where a black dog reportedly burst through the doors during a thunderstorm, killed two parishioners, and caused church damage. Despite its fearsome reputation, Black Shuck is often reported as simply appearing and watching, sometimes even acting **protectively**. The legend inspired Arthur Conan Doyle's **\\\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\\"** and represents a widespread tradition of spectral black dogs found throughout the British Isles."
