      "full": "The Bogeyman is a **universal figure** found in nearly every culture worldwide, representing a shapeless monster or malevolent being used to frighten children into obedience and good behavior. Unlike most folklore creatures with specific characteristics, **the Bogeyman is deliberately vague and formless** - described variably as: This **lack of fixed form** allows children's imaginations to fill in the terrifying details, making the Bogeyman uniquely personal to each child. The figure serves as a cautionary tool used by parents and caregivers to enforce bedtime, discourage dangerous behavior, and promote obedience. The Bogeyman exists in countless cultural variations (El Coco, Babau, Butzemann, etc.) but always serves the same fundamental purpose: **personifying childhood fears and consequences of misbehavior**."
