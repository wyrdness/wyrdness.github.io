      "full": "Area 51 is a highly classified remote detachment of Edwards Air Force Base, located within the Nevada Test and Training Range approximately 83 miles north-northwest of Las Vegas. Officially known as Groom Lake, the facility has been at the center of UFO conspiracy theories since the 1950s. The U.S. government did not officially acknowledge Area 51's existence until 2013, when the CIA released declassified documents confirming the base was used for testing the U-2 spy plane, SR-71 Blackbird, F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter, and other classified aircraft. The extreme secrecy surrounding these programs, combined with high-altitude test flights that civilians misidentified as UFOs, fueled decades of speculation."
