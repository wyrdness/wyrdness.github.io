      "full": "Akaname, whose name literally means \\\"filth licker,\\\" is a distinctive yokai from Japanese folklore that inhabits dirty, neglected bathrooms. This small humanoid creature appears at night in bathrooms that have been left unclean, using its characteristically long tongue to lick filth, grime, mold, and accumulated dirt from walls, floors, and fixtures. Depicted with grimy skin, disheveled hair, and a generally grotesque appearance, Akaname is nonetheless harmless to humans—its presence serves more as a consequence and reminder of poor hygiene than as a genuine threat. The yokai embodies a practical folk belief designed to encourage cleanliness and proper maintenance of bathrooms, particularly traditional Japanese baths. The simple prevention is maintaining cleanliness—Akaname will not appear in a well-kept bathroom."
