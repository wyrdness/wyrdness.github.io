      "full": "Cerberus is the monstrous **multi-headed dog** that guards the gates of the Greek underworld. Typically depicted with **three heads** (though some early versions describe 50 or even 100 heads), Cerberus has a **serpent for a tail** and a **mane of writhing snakes**. As the offspring of the giants Typhon and Echidna, Cerberus is sibling to other famous monsters including the Hydra and Chimera. His primary role is to **prevent the dead from escaping the underworld**, not to prevent entry—the ancient Greeks believed the dead entered Hades freely but could never leave. Cerberus features in several Greek myths, most famously when **captured by Hercules** as his twelfth and final labor, and when **charmed to sleep by Orpheus' music**. The creature symbolizes the threshold between life and death, representing an insurmountable obstacle and the finality of death."
