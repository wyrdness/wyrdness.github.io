      "full": "Anubis (Inpw in ancient Egyptian, also called Anpu) is one of the most iconic deities of ancient Egypt - the jackal-headed god who presided over mummification, guided souls through the underworld, and protected the dead. As the original Egyptian god of death before being partially supplanted by Osiris, Anubis remained central to funerary practices for over 3,000 years. His distinctive black jackal or dog form, associated with cemeteries and the color of fertile soil/rebirth, made him instantly recognizable and deeply revered throughout Egyptian civilization."
