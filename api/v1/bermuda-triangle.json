      "full": "The Bermuda Triangle is a loosely defined region in the western North Atlantic Ocean where numerous ships and aircraft have disappeared under circumstances characterized as mysterious or unexplained. The area roughly forms a triangle between Miami (Florida), Bermuda, and San Juan (Puerto Rico), covering approximately 500,000 square miles of ocean. The term was coined by writer Vincent Gaddis in 1964. Reports include compass malfunctions, electronic failures, unusual weather phenomena, and complete disappearances without distress signals or wreckage. Famous incidents include the 1945 disappearance of Flight 19, the 1918 loss of USS Cyclops with 306 people, and the vanishing of aircraft Star Tiger and Star Ariel in 1948-49. While many attribute these incidents to paranormal or extraterrestrial causes, skeptics point to statistical analysis showing the region has no higher incident rate than other heavily-traveled ocean areas. The U.S. Coast Guard does not recognize the Bermuda Triangle as particularly hazardous. Natural explanations include powerful Gulf Stream currents, frequent tropical storms, magnetic anomalies, methane hydrate eruptions, and human error."
